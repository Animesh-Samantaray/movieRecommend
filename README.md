# Movie Recommendation System ðŸŽ¬
A simple **Movie Recommendation System** built using Python, NLP, and machine learning techniques. The system suggests movies similar to a given movie using **text-based features** like movie overviews and plots.

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how to build a **movie recommendation system** from scratch using Python and NLP.
### **Key Steps**
**âœ¨ Data:** Collected a rich movie dataset from **Kaggle** containing movie titles, plots, genres, and more.  
**ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing:** Cleaned text data by removing stopwords and performing **stemming** using **NLTK**.  
**ðŸ“Š Vectorization:** Converted movie plots into numeric vectors using **CountVectorizer**.  
**ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation:** Calculated **cosine similarity** between movie plots to find the **10 most similar movies**.  
**ðŸ’» Deployment:** Deployed the system as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**. Users can enter a movie and get instant recommendations.

## **Installation & Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Animesh-Samantaray/movieRecommend.git
cd movieRecommend
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
4. Enter a movie title in the input box to see **recommended movies**.

## **Future Improvements**
- Integrate **user ratings** for collaborative filtering recommendations.  
- Use **TF-IDF or embeddings** for better text similarity.  
- Enhance **UI/UX** of the Streamlit app.
